Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping drug discovery, and cloud computing plays a critical role in this transformation. By leveraging cloud-based AI tools, pharmaceutical companies and researchers can streamline the process of identifying potential drug candidates.


## How Cloud AI is Changing Drug Discovery
Traditional drug discovery can take 10-15 years and cost billions of dollars. Cloud-based AI solutions are revolutionizing this process by:
- Predicting drug interactions faster
- Identifying new therapeutic targets
- Analyzing massive biological datasets in real-time

### Case Study: AlphaFold
DeepMind’s AlphaFold, a cloud-based AI system, has dramatically improved our ability to predict protein structures, an essential step in drug development. By hosting these models on cloud platforms, researchers worldwide can access and utilize cutting-edge AI without requiring their own high-performance computing infrastructure.

## Conclusion
Cloud computing and AI are together making drug discovery more efficient and cost-effective. As pharmaceutical companies integrate these technologies, we can expect faster innovation and more accessible treatments for various diseases.
